# Windows Apps Updater

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Interface languages:** Brazilian Portuguese, English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Russian. The program detects Windows UI culture and uses Brazilian Portuguese for unsupported locales.

## What it does

Single-file, one-click Batch utility that upgrades winget-managed application packages. It does not install hardware drivers.

## Files

Update-Drivers-And-Apps.bat (single-file utility; no separate PS1 script)

## Usage

1. Download or clone the complete repository.
2. Run `Update-Drivers-And-Apps.bat`. Approve the UAC prompt if Windows requests it.

## Requirements

Windows 10 version 1809 or later and Microsoft App Installer (winget). Some package installers may request UAC elevation.

## Safety and limitations

The project must not remove personal data, credentials, or content outside paths defined by the tool. Command and feature availability depends on Windows edition and version. Review CHANGELOG.md before updating.

## Development

See AGENTS-PT-BR.md and AGENTS-EN.md. The default interface language follows Windows UI culture; Brazilian Portuguese is the fallback.

## Languages, purpose, and tips

The interface supports Brazilian Portuguese, English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Russian. It detects Windows UI culture and uses Brazilian Portuguese as the fallback.

This utility updates winget-managed packages, not hardware drivers. Use Windows Update or the device manufacturer for drivers. Close apps and connect laptops to power.
